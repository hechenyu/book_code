ACKNOWLEGEMENT:

	The authors would like to thank Christian Kreiner of the Institut f.
	Technische Informatik, Technische Universitaet Graz, 
	Graz, Austria for developing the X implemention of the
	graphics software.

CONTENTS of this directory:

ezdraw.c 
   X11/unix implementation of EzDraw graphics library (v. 1.7)
   needed to run example programs from the books
   Ford/Topp: "Introduction to Computing using C++ and Object Technology"
	and "Data Structures with C++ using STL" on X11/Unix boxes.
  
ezdraw.h
   modified header file for graphics package based on the version
   supplied with the books (use -D__unix compiler switch)

   dependencies:
      X11 Window System (Xlib, X-Toolkit, Athena widgets)
   tested with with the following OS/compiler configurations: 
      FreeBSD 2.2.x and 3.1 / g++ (2.7.2.1) 
      LINUX / g++
      Solaris7 / g++ (2.7.2/2.95.2)
    
comp.ezd
   script to compile  ezdraw.c and build library libezdraw.a


INSTRUCTIONS:

Run "./comp.ezd" to compile the graphics library.

Copy libezdraw.a  to /usr/local/ftsoft/lib for
	Introduction to Computing using C++ and Object Technology
or to /usr/local/ftsoftds/lib for
	Data Structures with C++ using STL
