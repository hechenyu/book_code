The contents of the directory are as follows:

include:
	The class header files

ch1 - ch16:
	The chapter programs

lib:
	Must contain the graphics library archive.
	See the file ../XEzDraw/README for directions on
	generating this archive for your system.

comp:
	A C Shell script that can be used to compile any program
	in the book.  For instance, the example compiles "prg1_1.cpp" and
	creates the executable file "prg1_1". Type "prg1_1" to
	run the program.

		% comp prg1_1.cpp
		% prg1_1


	It is recommended that the system administrator copy "comp"
	to "/usr/local/bin" so it is accessible to all users.

	You must change the shell variables "DISTINCLUDE" and "DISTLIB"
	in the shell script to specify the location of the book header 
	and graphics library files. It is recommended that the distribution
	be kept in "/usr/local/ftsoftds".

prwindow:
	Shell script that prints a window created by the graphics
	system to a postscript printer. For instance, these commands
	compile and run the application "prg15_ruler" in ch15 and send
	the output to a postscript printer.

		% comp prg15_ruler.cpp
		% prwindow  prg15_ruler

	When the user clicks the mouse while it is over the window,
	the graphic is printed on the default printer, which must be
	able to handle postscript. 


	The script assumes that the ImageMagick package has been installed
	and uses the application "convert" from the package. Obtain the
	package from the site "http://www.imagemagick.org/". It is
	recommended that the system administrator copy "prwindow"
	to "/usr/local/bin" so it is accessible to all users.
